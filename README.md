# Full-Stack-Practice
Practicing the full stack one by one

Some notes:

Basic JavaScript: Some of it makes no sense. Some of it is remarkably practical. I see why it has grown but I also see why so many people are up in arms about it. The programming concepts that it delivers are fun once you get to understand them.

MongoDB: The language is particular and at times requires a lot of brain space just to learn basic functions. It is well-organized but appears to be a mess to the common eye. I understand why a lot of people prefer it over the SQL family but I don't think I'll go beyond what I've already done with it.

Node and Express: It is a very simple-to-use server format, though I wouldn't attribute that to coding. I can't remember half the stuff that goes into the server-making function. But, I don't need to becausse it's reusabe and you only need it once per procject. Additionally, scaffolding is a blessing.
